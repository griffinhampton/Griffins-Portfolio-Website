# Griffin Hampton Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase both technical expertise and creative design. The site is fully responsive, animation-driven, and built entirely with **HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript**.

The project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined to create an immersive, performant, and visually compelling user experience without relying on heavy frameworks.

## Features

- **Modern UI/UX Design**  
  Gradient backgrounds, text effects, and layered visual components that establish a distinct aesthetic.

- **Custom JavaScript Animations**  
  - Particle systems including dust, glowing orbs, and shooting stars  
  - Canvas-rendered diamond clusters with physics-based interactions  
  - Animated, interactive text with fading and respawn logic

- **Responsive and Adaptive Layout**  
  Built mobile-first and optimized for a range of devices, from small screens to large displays.

- **External Links and Integrations**  
  - Contact page linking to LinkedIn, email, and other platforms  
  - Dedicated pages for About, Portfolio, and Resume

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  - Hardware-accelerated transitions  
  - Efficient use of the Canvas API for rendering  
  - Minimal external dependencies

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS3** — responsive layouts, gradients, text clipping, and animations  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — dynamic interactions and canvas-based rendering

## Lessons Learned

- DOM manipulation and event-driven design without frameworks  
- Mastery of the Canvas API for real-time animations  
- Using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth, asynchronous loops  
- Applying user-centric design principles for intuitive navigation  
- Integrating external resources into a seamless experience

## Next Steps

- Add dark/light mode theme toggle  
- Explore WebGL/Three.js for advanced 3D effects  
- Automate deployment with a CI/CD pipeline
