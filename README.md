Griffin Hampton Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase both technical expertise and creative design. The site is fully responsive, animation-driven, and built entirely with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined to create an immersive, performant, and visually compelling user experience without relying on heavy frameworks.

Features

Modern UI/UX Design
Gradient backgrounds, text effects, and layered visual components that establish a distinct aesthetic.

Custom JavaScript Animations

Particle systems including dust, glowing orbs, and shooting stars.

Canvas-rendered diamond clusters with physics-based interactions.

Animated, interactive text with fading and respawn logic.

Responsive and Adaptive Layout
Built mobile-first and optimized for a range of devices, from small screens to large displays.

External Links and Integrations

A contact page that links to external resources such as LinkedIn, email, and additional platforms.

Dedicated pages for About, Portfolio, and Resume, each styled for consistency.

Performance Optimizations

Hardware-accelerated transitions.

Efficient use of the Canvas API for rendering.

Minimal external dependencies.

Tech Stack

HTML5 for semantic structure and accessibility.

CSS3 for responsive layouts, advanced styling, gradients, and text clipping effects.

JavaScript (Vanilla) for dynamic animations, event handling, and canvas-based rendering.
